PROJECT TITLE: Stars and Stripes
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: learn about methods
VERSION or DATE: 8/30 
AUTHORS: Farzaan Nasar
PMR: This project was relatively easy. I instantiated the class and used the
methods to make a replica of the sample output. The runner class was a new concept,
but I learned the concept quickly.
