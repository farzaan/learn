PROJECT TITLE: 07.01 Circle Points
NAME: Farzaan Nasar
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A program that calculates the (x,y) coordinates of points on a circle of a given radius.
DATE: 12/3/2018
PMR: This was a relatively simple program after the planning stage. I was initally confused about the function of the program but writing out the program gave me a clear goal. The string and decimal fomatting was more straight forward this time. This was the first program where I used Static Java Methods.
