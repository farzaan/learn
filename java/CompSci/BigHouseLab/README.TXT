PROJECT TITLE: Big House
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Learn how to use method and java graphics tools
VERSION or DATE: 9/10
AUTHORS: Farzaan Nasar
Post-Mortem: I had to run the program many times as the different parts of the house were often mis-aligned. I had to fix the errors and run the program again. It was hard to eyeball the x and y coordinates.
